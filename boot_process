# what is BIOS

BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System.
It is firmware stored on a chip on the motherboard of computer.
BIOS is the first software that runs when you power on a computer.

Its main role is to:

Initialize hardware (CPU, RAM, keyboard, disks, etc.)
Perform POST (Power-On Self-Test) – checks if hardware is working properly
Load the bootloader from the boot device (like GRUB for Linux)
Pass control to the operating system

[Power ON]
     ↓
[BIOS Starts]
     ↓
[POST Check]
     ↓
[Find Boot Device]
     ↓
[Load Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)]
     ↓
[Boot OS (Linux, Windows)]


# what is MBR?

MBR stands for Master Boot Record. 
It is the first sector (512 bytes) of a storage device (like HDD or SSD).
It is used to boot the system.

The MBR's main job is to:

Store bootloader code to start the operating system.
Hold the partition table — the layout of the disk.

[Power ON]
    ↓
[BIOS/UEFI starts]
    ↓
[BIOS finds Boot Device]
    ↓
[Reads MBR (first 512 bytes)]
    ↓
[Executes Bootloader code from MBR]
    ↓
[Bootloader loads OS (Linux/Windows)]


# What is GRUB?

GRUB stands for GRand Unified Bootloader.
It is the bootloader used by most Linux distributions to load the operating system.
GRUB acts as the middleman between the BIOS/UEFI and the Linux kernel.

Its job is to:

Locate and load the kernel from the disk
Allow you to choose between multiple OSes (dual-boot)
Let you pass parameters to the kernel (e.g., recovery mode)
Finds the kernel (vmlinuz) and initrd (initial ramdisk), and loads them on kernel
Reads settings from /boot/grub/grub.cfg

[Power ON]
    ↓
[BIOS/UEFI]
    ↓
[MBR or EFI Partition loads GRUB]
    ↓
[GRUB loads Kernel & initrd]
    ↓
[Linux Kernel boots the OS]

#GRUB File Structure

/boot/grub/grub.cfg		=	Main configuration file
/boot/vmlinuz-*			=	Kernel image
/boot/initrd.img-*		=	Initial RAM disk
/etc/default/grub		=	Default settings, edited by user
/boot/grub/			=	GRUB stage files and modules


# What is kernel?

The Kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system.
It acts as a bridge between your computer's hardware and software.
kernel is loaded in to read only mode

# Use the Kernel

To control hardware (CPU, memory, devices)
To manage system resources
To allow multiple programs to run safely at the same time
To provide low-level interfaces for software applications
Schedules and runs multiple programs (processes)
Controls RAM usage between applications
Provides access to disk and filesystems
Controls user access to system resources
Handles internet and local network communication

[Bootloader (GRUB)]

[Kernel (vmlinuz)]
   ↓
[initramfs/init → /sbin/init → OS boots fully]

# Types of Kernels 

Monolithic	=	One large process handling everything (used by Linux)
Microkernel	=	Only core functions in kernel, rest in user space (used by Minix)
Hybrid		=	Mix of both (used by Windows, macOS)

# Kernel File Location

/boot/vmlinuz-*					 → The compressed Linux kernel image

/boot/initrd.img-* or /boot/initramfs-*		 → Temporary file systems loaded by the kernel

/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/			 → Kernel modules for your current kernel version
