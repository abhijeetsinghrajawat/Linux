# D-Bus

D-Bus, short for "Desktop Bus," is a message-oriented middleware system that enables 
communication between different processes on a Linux system.

Key Features and Concepts:
Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
Message Bus
System and Session Buses
Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and Signals
Security
Layered Architecture
Ubiquity

In essence, D-Bus allows applications to:
Share data and events: For example, an application can send a notification to 
the desktop environment when a new email arrives. 
Control other applications: A media player might use D-Bus to control the volume 
of an audio output device. 
Integrate with system services: NetworkManager, for example, uses D-Bus to manage 
network connections. 

# Ping

ping is a network diagnostic tool used to test the reachability of a host (IP address or domain) on an IP network and measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the origin to the destination.

Check if a server or device is online.
Measure network latency (delay).
Detect packet loss or network issues.
Verify DNS resolution (for domain names).

ex - ping google.com

| Command                                  | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ping google.com`                        | Checks connectivity to Google. Runs indefinitely until you stop it (`Ctrl+C`). |
| `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8`                      | Sends 4 ICMP echo requests to Googleâ€™s public DNS.                             |
| `ping -i 2 example.com`                  | Sends pings every 2 seconds instead of default 1 sec.                          |
| `ping -s 1000 8.8.8.8`                   | Sends a ping with a packet size of 1000 bytes.                                 |
| `ping -t 10 8.8.8.8` *(on some systems)* | Pings for 10 seconds and stops (not supported on all Linux distros).           |


# Natstat

netstat (short for network statistics) is a command-line tool used in Linux to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

To diagnose network issues
To check which ports are open
To view active TCP/UDP connections
To see which services are listening on which ports
To monitor network interface statistics

EX - netstat [options]

| Command         | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `netstat -tuln` | Lists all **listening** TCP/UDP ports without resolving names.      |
| `netstat -an`   | Shows all active connections and listening ports.                   |
| `netstat -plnt` | Shows listening TCP ports with associated **PID** and program name. |
| `netstat -r`    | Displays the **kernel routing table**.                              |
| `netstat -i`    | Displays network **interface statistics**.                          |
| `netstat -s`    | Shows **network statistics** (packets sent/received, errors, etc).  |
| `netstat -g`    | Shows **multicast group membership**.                               |


# TraceRoute

traceroute is a network diagnostic tool.
it is used to trace the path that a packet takes from source h>
It shows each hop (router) the packet travels through and how >

#use 

To diagnose network delays or failures
To identify where in the network path packets are being droppe>
To check the routing path from source to destination
To troubleshoot connectivity issues

# Where We Use It

Network administration and troubleshooting
Identifying latency in a network path
Checking route changes during outages
Verifying ISP routing behavior

Ex - traceroute google.com

# nslookup

nslookup is a command-line tool used to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers to 
retrieve information about domain names, IP addresses, and other DNS records.
Example: nslookup www.google.com
