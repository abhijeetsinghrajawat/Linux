# What is AWK?

awk is a powerful text-processing command in Linux/Unix used for pattern scanning and report generation.
It's especially useful for filtering, transforming, and reporting data in text files or streams, particularly those that are column-based like logs, CSVs, etc.

# Why Use awk?

Extract specific columns from text
Apply conditions and filters
Perform calculations on data
Generate formatted reports
Replace or transform fields

awk 'pattern { action }' filename

pattern: condition to match (optional)
action: what to do if the pattern matches
filename: the input file

# Common Examples
Print the entire file
awk '{print}' file.txt

Print specific columns
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
Prints column 1 and 3 from each line.

Print lines where a column matches a value
awk '$3 > 50' data.txt
Prints lines where the 3rd column is greater than 50.

Print with a header
awk 'BEGIN {print "Name\tMarks"} {print $1, $2}' file.txt

Add values in a column
awk '{sum += $2} END {print "Total:", sum}' file.txt
Sums up all values in the 2nd column.

Use with delimiter
awk -F, '{print $1, $3}' data.csv
Uses a comma , as the field separator for CSV files.
