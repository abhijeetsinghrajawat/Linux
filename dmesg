# What is dmesg::::::::::::::::::

dmesg stands for display message. It is a command-line tool 
used to view messages from the kernel ring buffer — mainly 
related to hardware, device drivers, boot process, and system 
diagnostics.

# Purpose of dmesg:::::::::::

Troubleshoot hardware issues (disks, RAM, USB devices)
Monitor kernel messages
Analyze boot process logs
Debug device driver issues
Check for kernel panics or errors

# Source of dmesg Logs::::::

These messages are not traditional log files but are stored 
in kernel ring buffer (in memory). Some of this data is also 
logged in /var/log/dmesg, depending on your distro.

# What We Can Diagnose Using dmesg:::::::::::::::

| Issue                 | Detected With dmesg?     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| USB not detected      | ✅ Yes                    |
| Disk read errors      | ✅ Yes                    |
| Network card failures | ✅ Yes                    |
| Boot errors           | ✅ Yes                    |
| Software bugs         | ❌ No (kernel-level only) |

#Who Can Run It?::::::::::

Regular users can run dmesg, but some messages (especially 
related to secure boot or kernel crashes) may be restricted. 
Use with sudo to get full output:

sudo dmesg
