# What is SUID and SGID ::::::::::::::::::::

SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) are special permission bits that allow users to execute a file with the permissions of the file’s owner or group, rather than the permissions of the user running it.

#  1. SUID (Set User ID)

When a file has the SUID permission, it runs with the privileges of the file’s owner, not the user who is executing it.

Use Case:

We want a user to run a program as root temporarily (e.g., to change password or execute privileged commands), without giving them full root access.

Example ::::
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd

output ::::::
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 54256 Jan  1 09:12 /usr/bin/passwd

The s in the owner’s execute field (rws) means SUID is set.
It allows regular users to run /usr/bin/passwd as root, so they can update their password (which modifies /etc/shadow, a root-only file).

Set SUID:
chmod u+s filename

# 2. SGID (Set Group ID)

For files: When executed, it runs with the permissions of the file's group.
For directories: All new files created in that directory inherit the group of the directory, not the user’s primary group.

Use Case:

Shared Project Directory Example:

A group of developers needs to work on files in /shared/dev.
You set SGID on the directory so all new files inherit the dev group:

chmod g+s /shared/dev

Example::
ls -l filename
-rwxr-sr-x 1 user devgroup 12345 Jan 1 10:00 some_script

The s in the group permission means SGID is set.

Set SGID:
chmod g+s filename_or_directory

How to Remove Them:::::::::;;;;

Remove SUID: chmod u-s filename
Remove SGID: chmod g-s filename
