# Types of file syaytem :::::::::::::::::::

1. ext3
2. ext4
3. XFS (use in ubuntu, centos, redhat, fedora)
4. BtrFS (B-tree FS) [use in openSUSE and SUSE linux enterprise server]
5. Fat

# Check linux file system:::::::::::::::::::::

1. lsblk
2. df -Th
3. cat /etc/fstab

# What is inodes

An inode is like a file's identity card, storing all information about the file except its name and actual content. In linux every file and directory have a unique number.

Ex - "ls -li"

# Types of files in linux:::::::::::::::::::::::::

-	= Regular files

d	= Directory

l	= link

c	= Device file

s	= Socket

p	= FIFO or named pipe

b	= Block device

Socket file	= Special file to enablecommunication between two processes. basically these are inside /run folder.

FIFO or Named-pipe	= send data from one process to another so that the recieving precess reads the data first-in-first-out manner, can be created using mkfifo command.

Block Device	= A file that refers to a device.

# Linux file system :::::::::::::::::::::::::

/			= root directory, Top of the filesystem hierarchy. Every other directory starts here.

/bin			= Essential binaries – Commands like ls, cp, mv, bash used during boot.

/sbin			= System binaries – Administrative tools like fsck, reboot, ifconfig.

/usr			= User programs – Contains user-level applications and utilities.

/usr/bin		= Common user commands (e.g., nano, python).

/usr/sbin		= Non-essential system binaries (e.g., apache2, sshd).

/lib			= Shared libraries needed for binaries in /bin and /sbin.

/usr/lib		= Libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.

/etc			= Holds System Configuration files – (e.g.User, Network, services, SystemApps, /etc/passwd, /etc/hostname).

/etc/passwd		= Stores user account info (but not passwords).

/etc/shadow		= Stores hashed user passwords.

/etc/fstab		= Disk mount info – used during boot to mount drives.

/etc/hosts		= Static hostname to IP address mapping.

/etc/resolv.conf	= DNS resolver configuration.

/etc/hostname		= Contains the system’s hostname.

/etc/profile		= Global environment settings for all users.

/home			= Contains the personal User directories – Each user gets a folder (/home/alice, /home/bob).

/root			= Home directory for root user(Administrator). Not to be confused with /.

/var			= Variable data – Logs, spools, caches (e.g., /var/log).

/var/log		= System log files 

/tmp			= Temporary files

/opt			= Optional software – Manually installed software lives here.

/media			= Removable media – USB drives, CDs, etc. auto-mounted here.

/mnt			= Temporary mount point – Used for mounting filesystems manually.

/dev			= Device files – Represents hardware (e.g., /dev/sda)

/proc			= Virtual filesystem – Real-time system info (e.g., CPU, RAM, processes).

/proc/cpuinfo		= Info about CPU.

/proc/meminfo		= Info about MEMORY

/sys			= Interface to kernel – For tweaking devices and kernel modules.

/boot			= Kernel files and bootloader configs (e.g., vmlinuz, grub/).

/run			= Runtime variable data – PID files, sockets (cleared on boot).

/srv			= Data served by services (e.g., web or FTP).

/lost+found		= Recovered files after filesystem errors (ext* filesystems).

# Special Files :::::::::::::::::::::::::

/etc/bashrc		= Global shell settings (bash shell).

/etc/bash.bashrc	= Global shell settings (bash shell).

~/.bashrc		= User’s shell config – Aliases, PATH, prompts.

~/.profile		= User's login shell settings.

~/.ssh/authorized_keys	= SSH public keys allowed to connect.
