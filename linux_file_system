/bin			= Essential binaries – Commands like ls, cp, mv, bash used during boot.

/sbin			= System binaries – Administrative tools like fsck, reboot, ifconfig.

/usr			= User programs – Contains user-level applications and utilities.

/usr/bin		= Common user commands (e.g., nano, python).

/usr/sbin		= Non-essential system binaries (e.g., apache2, sshd).

/lib			= Shared libraries needed for binaries in /bin and /sbin.

/usr/lib		= Libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.

/etc			= Configuration files – System-wide settings (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/hostname).

/etc/passwd		= Stores user account info (but not passwords).

/etc/shadow		= Stores hashed user passwords.

/etc/fstab		= Disk mount info – used during boot to mount drives.

/opt			= Optional software – Manually installed software lives here.

/media			= Removable media – USB drives, CDs, etc. auto-mounted here.

/mnt			= Temporary mount point – Used for mounting filesystems manually.

/dev			= Device files – Represents hardware (e.g., /dev/sda)

/proc			= Virtual filesystem – Real-time system info (e.g., CPU, RAM, processes).

/proc/cpuinfo		= Info about CPU.

/proc/meminfo		= Info about MEMORY

/sys			= Interface to kernel – For tweaking devices and kernel modules.

/boot			= Kernel files and bootloader configs (e.g., vmlinuz, grub/).

/run			= Runtime variable data – PID files, sockets (cleared on boot).

/srv			= Data served by services (e.g., web or FTP).

/lost+found		= Recovered files after filesystem errors (ext* filesystems).
